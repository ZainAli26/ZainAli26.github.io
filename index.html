          <p class="w3-opacity">A platform for logistic operations, designed to streamline and optimize various aspects of the logistic and supply chain management process. It serves as a central hub for managing and coordinating the movement of goods and resources involved in the transportation and delivery of products.</p>
          <ul class="w3-opacity">
            <li><b>Information Extraction From Documents:</b>I was in charge of leading a team that developed several APIs responsible for extracting information from images. The images were logistics documents from where we were extracting useful information.</li>
            <li><b>Buisness & Engineer Analytics:</b>I also lead a team of Data Analytics professionals to extract business and engineering metrics as well as conduct analytics and provide insights.

          <p class="w3-opacity">A smart cart is a shopping cart built to ease the shopping experience and make it cashier-less so that customers donâ€™t have the huddle of getting into lines. Cart major functionality works through camera sensors from which videos are captured and computer vision algorithms are applied to videos.</p>
          <ul class="w3-opacity">
            <li><b>Cloud Backend Services:</b> I contributed to building a catalog service that was responsible for serving the details of store products and searching the products in the store catalog. I also build a payment service that was responsible for fetching the prices from one of our clients API's and use to deduct prices using stripe integrations. Both the application were built using typescript using the fastify web framework. I used Google-Cloud-Run and Google-Cloud-Functions for application hosting.</li>
            <li><b>Media Service:</b> In this service, I build the media pipelines using GStreamer for live-streaming the videos from multiple cameras over the network and to record and serve the session videos for later analysis.</li>
            <li><b>Real-Time Object-Recognition Service for Edge Devices:</b> It was a real-time video processing service to process the videos from multiple cameras. It was built and optimized especially for running on edge devices. It was an object recognition pipeline that was built by using a combination of object detection, object classification, and object-tracking algorithms.</li>
            <li><b>Computer Vision Research:</b> Contributed to successful research in computer vision to build the object-detection, object-classification, and object-tracking algorithms which were of great worth for the project. I also build the algorithms for background subtraction and gesture detection (To detect the insertion and removals from the cart) which has the most significant value for the product.</li>
            <li><b>DevOps:</b> In DevOps, I worked on building the deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins and Ansible. I also worked with terraforms for cloud provisioning of the cloud infrastructure of the application.

          <p class="w3-opacity">This was a project of a music production company that has a desktop application to convert images of written music to a digital music format. The project's main purpose was to improve the performance of the OMR(Optical Music Recognition: The technique of converting the images of written music to digital format) system for the application.</p>
          <ul class="w3-opacity">
            <li><b>OMR Research:</b> I worked on improving the accuracy of the OMR using computer vision and deep learning techniques. We applied different state-of-the-art techniques and analyzed the results, and formalized a technique to improve on the state-of-the-art techniques. I also write a research paper with the help of a few other people which is currently being submitted to a journal.</li>
            <li><b>Software Integration:</b> In this project, we also integrated the improved OMR system with better accuracy into the legacy software.</li>

The user can also add their activities to look up different partners to join them in those activities.</p>
          <ul class="w3-opacity">
            <li><b>Text Categorization:</b> I worked on categorizing the content based on the text in 32 general categories. I applied text classification using deep learning and basic NLP(Natural Language Processing) concepts to achieve the desired results.</li>
            <li><b>Content Similarity for Recommendation:</b> I worked on the content similarity based on the text descriptions of the content to recommend similar content to one currently viewed on the app by the user. This was also done using deep learning models and NLP techniques.</li>
            <li><b>Obscene Content Filtering:</b> I build the service to filter the obscene or PG content based on the text descriptions.</li>
            <li><b>Web Application:</b> I worked on building the web application for the product which was just a mobile app before. The application was built using the angular framework.</li>

          <p class="w3-opacity">The project was to build the proof of concept for different medical problems using advanced techniques of computer vision and deep learning. Many medical problems were solved through deep learning in this project, and computer vision and APIs were built around them.</p>
          <ul class="w3-opacity">
            <li><b>Cancer Cell Classification:</b> I worked to classify cancer cells based on deep learning models and computer vision techniques.</li>
            <li><b>Thyroid Nodule Segmentation:</b> I worked on segmenting the thyroid nodule using image segmentation techniques which were also based on deep learning models.</li>
            <li><b>Brain Tumor Classification:</b> I also worked to identify the type of brain tumor from the MRI. This was also done using computer vision and deep learning.</li>
            <li><b>Application API:</b> Along with solving all of the above-mentioned problems I also worked on building and deploying the APIs for all these problems I have solved in this project. The APIs were built using the Flask framework in python language.</li>
